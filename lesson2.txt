Standardized Reflections:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	* git converts the folder into a valid repository by adding a .git folder and you need to do this so that you can start making commits.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	* A git Working Folder is the project folder that contains all your actual files and has a git repository inside it.
	* A git Repository is the .git folder inside your Working Directory that contains your entire commit history and that makes the project folder a git working directory.
	* You can choose to selectively commit certain files only, by bundling them into a 'Staging Area' and then committing that.
